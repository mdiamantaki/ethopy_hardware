# 3D Designs for EthoPy Hardware

This folder contains 3D-printable `.stl` files for components used in the EthoPy Open-field setup.

## Included Models

- `open-field_bottom_corner.stl` – Bottom corner brackets
- `open-field_top_corner.stl` – Top corner brackets

All models are designed for ease of printing and assembly, with minimal support requirements.

## Recommended Print Settings

> We use a Zortrax M200 Plus with the Z-ULTRAT material and the default settings and support. However, other FDM printers and ABS, PLA, PETG material should also work. Adjust for your printer as needed.

## Notes

- Make sure to orient parts flat on the print bed to avoid unnecessary supports.
- All parts can be printed in the current orientation
