## Recommended Print Settings

> We use a Zortrax M200 Plus with the Z-ULTRAT material and the default settings and support. However, other FDM printers and ABS, PLA, PETG material should also work. Adjust for your printer as needed.

## Notes

- Make sure to orient parts flat on the print bed to avoid unnecessary supports.
- All parts can be printed in the current orientation
